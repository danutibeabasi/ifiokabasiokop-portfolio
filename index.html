            <h2>Client Review</h2>
            <p>"It was 2023, I was looking to get employed but I didn't have a CV. I checked online on how to write one, but I still wasn't getting it. There were many templates that I used but it just wasn't sitting well.</p>
            <p>Then Dianaabasi, Ifiok's elder sister referred her to me. When I told Ifi about it, she put me through step by step till I got it. She sent me a template, and walked me through the process of writing the CV, asking very crucial questions to help strengthen the quality of my CV.</p>
            <p>In my very first job interview, the interviewer mentioned specifically that it was my CV that drew him to me even though I didn't have the experiences they were looking for. He commented that it was such a good CV and he loved it.</p>
            <p>Ifi knows her onions really well, and I'm a witness to that." - Moyosoluwa Olotu</p>
